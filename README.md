This work was part of an assignment I was folowing on coursera HTML, CSS, and "Javascript for Web Developers
by Johns Hopkins University".

This assignment consisted the following parameters:
<ol>Use of Inline Styles</ol>
<ol>A default Bootstrap navbar</ol><p>
Implemented that such that scrolls away with the top of the page. The company name “Food, LLC” is aligned to the left side of the navbar and has the styles of navbar-brand class</ol><p>

<ol>Navbar Mobile View</ol><p>
Dropdown menu button is only visible in this view, i.e., if you check the browser’s width, the button should NOT show up unless the width of the browser is less than 768px. Use Chrome Developer Tools to verify width if you are not sure at a glance.
<ol>Dropdown Menu</ol>
<ol>Page Heading</ol>
<p>
The page heading “Our Menu” is centered on the screen using a Bootstrap class. Right-click on the page heading and choose “Inspect Element” to verify.
<ol>Single Cell Grid Section</ol>
I hosted the pages using Github Pages feature.
